### Automated Parking Valet with ROS 2 in Simulink

This example shows how to distribute the Automated Parking Valet application among various nodes in a ROS 2 network in SimulinkÂ® and deploy them as standalone ROS 2 nodes. Using the Simulink model in the Automated Parking Valet in Simulink example, tune the planner, controller and vehicle dynamic parameters before partitioning the model into ROS 2 nodes.
